Current practises often involve manual checks. 
To address these challenges, there is a critical need to develop automated auditing scripts tailored to CIS benchmarks. 
Detailed description: This software solution aimed to list out the control guidelines as per CIS benchmark for the following operating systems: - 
Windows (Reference www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/Microsoft_winodws_desktop) i. Windows 11 (Enterprise version) 
ii. Windows 11 (Standalone version) Linux (Reference:www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/red_hat_linux, www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/ubuntu_linux) 
i. Redhat Enterprise (8 and 9) ii. Ubuntu desktop (20.04 LTS, 22.04 LTS) 
iii. Ubuntu server (12.04LTS and 14.04 LTS) Preferable scripting language (PowerShell for Windows, bash/python for Linux)



A user-friendly GUI based solution with capability to generate a report of findings.
Scripts should be reliable and accurate in identifying the deviations from best practices outlined in CIS benchmarks.
Should facilitate easy update and maintenance to accommodate changes in benchmarks over time.
