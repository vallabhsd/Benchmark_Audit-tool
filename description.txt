Expected solution: 

i. A user-friendly GUI based solution with capability to generate a report of findings.

ii. Should be customizable as per organizational needs and scale to audit large and diverse IT environments effectively. 

iii. Scripts should be reliable and accurate in identifying the deviations from 

iv. best practices outlined in CIS benchmarks. 

v. Should facilitate easy update and maintenance to accommodate changes in benchmarks over time.

Languages : Bash and Powershell


Key Steps

Understand the CIS Benchmarks for Windows 11 and your Linux distribution (e.g. Debian, CentOS, Rocky Linux).

Leverage CIS-CAT Pro to scan systems and identify conformance to benchmark recommendations.

Automate hardening using CIS Build Kits with GPOs for Windows 11 and Bash scripts for Linux.

(Optional) Create a custom auditing script in PowerShell for Windows 11 or Bash for Linux. This allows full customization but requires more development effort.

Incorporate checks for all benchmark sections relevant to your OS, such as filesystem permissions, network settings, user accounts, etc.

Output results in a format suitable for reporting, such as CSV, JSON or plain text
